# SimpleCounter
Built a simple counter app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that updates values on button clicks
## Features
- Increment and decrement a counter
- Tracks clicks on Increment and Decrement buttons
- Resets click counters when they reach 10
- Clean and responsive UI

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How It Works
- HTML provides the structure of the counter and buttons.
- CSS styles the layout and appearance.
- JavaScript handles updating the counter and click counts when buttons are clicked using inline `onclick` attributes.

## What I Learned
- Linking external CSS and JS files properly
- Using `getElementById` and `textContent` to update page content dynamically
- Handling basic user interactions with buttons
- Debugging issues when JS doesn’t load externally
